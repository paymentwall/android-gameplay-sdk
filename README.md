## HOW TO RUN DEMO APP

1. **Setup Project Credentials**: To run Demo app, you need to setup your server and project keys. Obtain these Paymentwall API credentials in the application settings of your Merchant Account at Paymentwall.com
```kotlin
object Constants {
    // Endpoint on the merchant's server that make a charge requests to Brick API.
    const val MERCHANT_CHARGE_ENDPOINT = "https://merchant-server.com/api/charge"

    // Secure URL to which the 3DS widget will redirect after successful authentication.
    // After redirection, the merchant should call MERCHANT_CHARGE_ENDPOINT again with the `token` to finalize the charge.
    const val THREE_DS_RETURN_URL = "https://merchant-server.com/return-url"

    // production test
    const val PW_PROJECT_KEY = "";
    const val PW_SECRET_KEY = ""; // Should be get from merchant's server
...
}
```

2. **Run the Demo**:
   * Select your device/emulator
   * Click Run button

## CORE SDK INTEGRATION

For detailed integration instructions, please refer to our comprehensive documentation:

### Quick Start Guide:

1. **Implement Event Handler**:
```kotlin
class MainActivityViewModel : ViewModel(), IGPAPIEventHandler {
    init {
        GPApi.setEventHandler(this)
    }

    override fun onResp(resp: BaseResp?) {
        when (resp?.resultCode) {
            ResponseCode.SUCCESSFUL -> {
                isProcessing = false
                paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.Success("Payment completed successfully!")
            }

            ResponseCode.FAILED -> {
                isProcessing = false
                paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.Failed("Payment failed!")
            }

            ResponseCode.CANCEL -> {
                isProcessing = false
                paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.Cancelled("Payment cancelled!")
            }

            ResponseCode.ERROR -> {
                isProcessing = false
                paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.Unknown("An error occurred!")
            }

            ResponseCode.MERCHANT_PROCESSING -> {
                isProcessing = false

                val serviceType = resp.data.getStringExtra(GPApi.KEY_SERVICE_TYPE) ?: ""

                if (GPApi.SERVICE_TYPE_BRICK == serviceType) {
                    val email = resp.data.getStringExtra(GPApi.KEY_BRICK_EMAIL) ?: ""
                    val token = resp.data.getStringExtra(GPApi.KEY_BRICK_TOKEN) ?: ""

                    // Process the payment with current charge details
                    if (token.isNotEmpty() && email.isNotEmpty()) {
                        processPayment(token, email)
                    } else {
                        paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.Unknown("Invalid payment data received")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

2. **Create a payment request**:
```kotlin
class MainActivityViewModel : AppCompatActivity(), IGPAPIEventHandler {
    fun createPaymentRequest(): UnifiedRequest {
        val request = UnifiedRequest()
        request.pwProjectKey = Constants.PW_PROJECT_KEY
        request.pwSecretKey = Constants.PW_SECRET_KEY

        request.amount = chargeAmount
        request.currency = chargeCurrency
        request.userId = uid
        request.userEmail = Constants.USER_EMAIL
        request.itemId = Constants.ITEM_GEM_ID
        request.itemName = Constants.ITEM_NAME
        request.merchantName = Constants.MERCHANT_NAME
        request.timeout = 30000
        request.signVersion = 3

        request.addBrick()
        request.enableFooter()
        request.addGooglePay()

        request.addPayAlto()
        request.addPayAltoParams(Const.P.WIDGET, "t3_1")
        request.addPayAltoParams(Const.P.COUNTRY_CODE, country)

        return request
    }
}
```

3. **Start Payment**:
```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    private fun createPaymentRequest() {
        val request = vm.createPaymentRequest()
        GPApi.sendReq(this, request)
    }
}
```
